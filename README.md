## About

The goal of this project is to serve as a community developed interactive reference for the OpenType specification, typeface source code specifications, and free software tools used to develop fonts.  

The project uses executable [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files to:

- serve as a guide to existing OpenType specification, typeface source code specification, and free typeface software library documentation
- document common free typeface development library use areas and provide a central repository of source code snippets that demonstrate how a developer might approach these use cases
- support simple source code modifications within the jupyter notebook file  for more detailed exploration of each topic area
- support a remote source execution approach that does not require the user to download, install, create and activate virtual execution environments, or execute any files locally (notebook files are executed on [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com))
- release all source code examples as free software for use under the [Apache v2.0 License](LICENSE)


The project is open to contributions from anyone, and we highly encourage your feedback and involvement!
